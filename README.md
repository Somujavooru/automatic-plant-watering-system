# Automatic Plant Watering System 🌱💧

This project automates the watering of plants using **Arduino**, a **soil moisture sensor**, and a **mini water pump**.  
It was developed as part of my **Physics CIE Project (VTU, 2023)** at **Bapuji Institute of Engineering and Technology, Davangere**.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Soil moisture sensor detects when the soil is dry.  
2. Arduino processes the sensor data.  
3. If water is needed, the pump activates and waters the plant.  
4. Pump stops automatically when the required moisture is reached.  
5. Servo motor can rotate to direct water across soil.

## ⚡ Usage
1. Open `code/watering_system.ino` in **Arduino IDE**.  
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB.  
3. Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.  
4. Upload the code.  
5. Place the soil moisture sensor into the soil.  
6. Connect the pump and power supply.  
7. The system will automatically water the plant when the soil is dry.
